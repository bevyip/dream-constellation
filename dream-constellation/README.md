# Dream Emotion Constellation

An interactive visualization that transforms anonymous dream survey data into an explorable constellation of human emotional experiences.

## Concept

This project addresses a key finding from the dream survey: **people struggle to articulate their dreams verbally**. By visualizing dreams spatially rather than textually, the constellation allows viewers to explore collective dream patterns through interaction and proximity rather than language.

## Features

- **19 Dreams Visualized**: Each star represents one survey response
- **Color-Coded Emotions**: 
  - Red: Anxious/Stressed (42% of responses)
  - Blue: Confused/Disoriented
  - Green: Happy/Relieved
  - Orange: Fearful/Threatened
  - Yellow: Other emotions
- **Interactive Exploration**: Hover over any star to reveal the dream details
- **Spatial Clustering**: Dreams with similar emotions naturally cluster together
- **Animated Connections**: Subtle lines connect related dreams

## Technical Implementation

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- p5.js for canvas rendering and particle system
- Responsive design that adapts to window size
- No backend required - fully client-side

## Research Insights Demonstrated

1. **Emotional Distribution**: Visual representation shows anxiety dominates dream experiences (8/19 responses)
2. **Conditional Dreaming**: 6 respondents noted dreams correlate with specific emotional states
3. **Communication Barriers**: Spatial visualization bypasses verbal articulation difficulties
4. **Collective Patterns**: Individual dreams form meaningful patterns when viewed together

## How to Present

1. **Open with the data**: Show the survey responses and analysis
2. **Reveal the constellation**: Navigate to the live visualization
3. **Interactive demo**: Hover over stars during presentation to show interactivity
4. **Discuss insights**: Connect back to research on dreams, identity, and emotional processing

## Future Directions

- Allow viewers to add their own dreams to the constellation
- Implement filtering by emotion or dream characteristic
- Create time-based animations showing how dream patterns evolve
- Export constellation as shareable image or video
- Connect to real-time biometric data for "live dreaming" visualization
